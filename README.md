# Assignment-one Dormitory Room Allocation â€“ Description

This project applies Python concepts to manage dormitory room data. It uses integers to calculate totals, averages, minimums, and maximums. Strings with f-strings generate summary reports, while booleans check if averages meet a threshold using compound conditions. Lists store and modify room records, and arrays handle fixed-size numeric subsets for comparison with lists. Finally, dictionaries manage detailed room records, allowing updates, deletions, and total value computation.
